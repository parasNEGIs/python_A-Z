# 9.0 OPERATORS

"""
Python provides us with various types of operators:
-Arithmetic         -Assignment
-Comparison         -Logical
-Identity           -Membership
-Bitwise
"""

# Arithmetic operator
"""
for arithmetic operations
ie. + , - , * , /  (basic ones)
    // (floor division )
    ** (exponential power)
    %  (modulus ie. remainder)        
"""

# Assignment operator
"""
to assign values
ie. = (basic)
   += , -= , *= , /= ..etc 
      (binary operations)
"""

# Comparison operator
"""
to compare values 
ie. == , > , <    (basic operators) 
    != , <= , >=  (advance operators)
"""

# Logical operator
""""
to check logic (through boolean truth method)
ie.  or , and , not
"""

# Identity operator
""""
to check the identity of values
ie. is , is not
"""

# Membership operator
"""
to check availability/membership of values
ie. in , not in
"""

# Bitwise operator
"""
to perform binary operations
ie. & - and
    | - or
    ~ - not
    ^ - xor
also: shift operators , bitwise operator overloading  
"""

# note
'''
== - value equality
  (two objects have same value)
is - refrence equality
  (two refrences refer to same object)
